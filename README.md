# Muscle Resistivity Calculating Machine
This project build to calculate Baseball players strength. It is calculate players passing speed and display it to analyzing data.




## Application
1. Muscle Resistivity calculating android application
2. Muscle Resistivity check arduino application.

## How It works
  It measure human strength of hand using arduino. It used various of sensors. Finaly mesurement sent to android device though bluetooth technology.
  
### 1. Muscle Resistivity calculating android application
This is bluetooth connection application with Arduino devices. This application is help to connect with H6 Bluetooth module in Arduino device and transfer data. In that case we can show data with graph. This application mainly use for final year project of university. You can also use it to easy connect with this.
Procedure of this. Click beginning to connect with device and on your device bluetooth module. If it occur any trouble you can use manual connection with your bluetooth devices. after your can transfer and received data from it.
